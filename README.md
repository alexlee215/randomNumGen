This respository is for the research of random number generation methods and discovering how random they actually are.
The program I have used to determine the randomness of a provided list of digits is the program RaBiGeTe, which can be found at the website [Here](http://cristianopi.altervista.org/RaBiGeTe_MT/#updates)
This program was essential in providing the randomness tests as well as providing a series of graphs and charts that can be used to show the data visually.
The following graphs are the output I received from my testing of 5000 provided integers between 1 and 1000000.
